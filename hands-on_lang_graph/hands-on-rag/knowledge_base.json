The architecture relies on self-attention mechanisms rather than recurrent or convolutional neural networks. This design allows for more parallelization during training and better handling of long-range dependencies in text.",

It is pre-trained using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks. BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.",

Unlike BERT, which is bidirectional, GPT models are unidirectional and predict the next token based on previous tokens. The original GPT was introduced by OpenAI in 2018, followed by GPT-2 in 2019 and GPT-3 in 2020, each significantly larger than its predecessor.",

    "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines a retrieval system with a text generator. The retriever fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base, and these documents are then provided as context to the generator. RAG models can be fine-tuned end-to-end and leverage large pre-trained models like BART or T5 for generation. This approach helps ground the generated text in factual information.",
