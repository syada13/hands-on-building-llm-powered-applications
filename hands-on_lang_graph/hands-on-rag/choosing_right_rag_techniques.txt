Choosing the right techniques:

When implementing advanced RAG techniques, consider the specific requirements and constraints of your application. 

For technical or specialized domains with complex terminology, hybrid retrieval provides a strong foundation by capturing both semantic relationships and exact terminology. When dealing with lengthy documents where only portions are relevant, add contextual compression to extract the most pertinent sections.

For applications where accuracy and transparency are critical, implement source attribution and self-consistency checking to ensure that generated responses are faithful to the retrieved information. If users frequently submit ambiguous or poorly formulated queries, query transformation techniques can help bridge the gap between user language and document terminology.

So when should we choose each approach?

  1. Start with naive RAG for quick prototyping and simple question-answering
  2. Add hybrid retrieval when facing vocabulary mismatch issues or mixed content types
  3. Implement re-ranking when the initial retrieval quality needs refinement
  4. Use query transformation for complex queries or when users struggle to articulate information needs.
  5. Apply context processing when dealing with limited context windows or redundant information.
  6. Add response enhancement for applications requiring high trustworthiness and attribution
  7. Consider CRAG when reliability and factual accuracy are mission-critical
  8. Explore Agentic RAG for complex, multi-step information tasks requiring reasoning


Production RAG systems:
In practice, production RAG systems often combine multiple approaches. For example, a robust enterprise system might use hybrid retrieval with query transformation, apply context processing to optimize the retrieved information, enhance responses with source attribution, and implement CRAGâ€™s evaluation layer for critical applications.

Start with implementing one or two key techniques that address your most pressing challenges, then measure their impact on performance metrics like relevance, accuracy, and user satisfaction. Add additional techniques incrementally as needed, always considering the tradeoff between improved results and increased computational costs.
