Store chat message history in-memory using InMemoryChatMessageHistory class.
This class extends BaseListChatMessageHistory class and provides methods to get, add and clear messages.

RunnableWithMessageHistory: It is used to incorporate previous messages into a runnable chain, enabling the development of applications that can quickly retrieve and utilize conversation history. This concept is particularly useful in chatbot applications where maintaining context is crucial. By using RunnableWithMessageHistory, developers can focus on building the core functionality of their applications without worrying about the complexities of managing chat memory.

 a. We create a fake chat model with a callback that prints out the amount of input messages each time itâ€™s called. 

 b. Then we initialize the dictionary that keeps histories, and we create a separate function that returns a history given the session_id:

 FakeListChatModel is a part of LangChain's FakeChatModel classes, which are designed to help test error handling in chains by simulating LLM failures. This class specifically takes a list of messages and returns them one by one on each invocation, allowing for controlled testing of how a chain handles different responses.

"""
The config dictionary is used to specify the configuration for the chain, including callbacks and configurable settings. In below example:
   The "callbacks" key can be used to specify a list of callback functions, such as PrintOutputCallback(). 
   The "configurable" key can be used to specify a session_id, which ensures that the agent can track the conversation within the same session
"""
config ={"callbacks": [PrintOutputCallback()],"configurable":{"session_id": "1"}}

#Testing : Make sure that our history keeps all the interactions with the user but a trimmed history is passed to the LLM:
_ = chain.invoke([HumanMessage("Hi Suresh!")],config = config)

print(f"History length: {len(sessions['1'].messages)}")

_ = chain.invoke(
    [HumanMessage("How are you?")],
    config=config,
)
print(f"History length: {len(sessions['1'].messages)}")

"""Production Usage Note :

When designing a real application, you should be cautious about managing access to somebodys sessions. For example, if you use a sequential session_id, users might easily access sessions that dont belong to them. Practically, it might be enough to use a uuid (a uniquely generated long identifier) instead of a sequential session_id, or, depending on your security requirements, add other permissions validations during runtime.
